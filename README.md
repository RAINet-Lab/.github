The Resilient AI Networking (RAINet) lab at IMDEA Networks undertakes research to advance the resiliency of AI algorithms in the context of 5G and 6G networks. We strive to develop new solutions that enhance the understanding and transparency of AI models and investigate methods for detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks against AI systems, thereby ensuring the robustness and security of these critical components of 5G and 6G networks.
